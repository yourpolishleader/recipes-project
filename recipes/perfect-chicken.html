		<h2>Description</h2>

		<p>Chicken stock, wine, onions, garlic, mushroom, cream, butter, herbs, lemon, and capers reduce to make a perfect sauce. Served alongside mushroom rice and asparagus; it is HEAVEN! Patience is key with the sauce. The flavors will come together beautifully if you allow them to reduce as directed.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
				<br>
			<li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
				<br>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
				<br>
			<li>1 cup white wine</li>
				<br>
			<li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste</li>
				<br>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
				<br>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
				<br>
			<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
				<br>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
				<br>
			<li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
				<br>
			<li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
				<br>
			<li>½ cup cornstarch, or as needed</li>
				<br>
			<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
				<br>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>

		<h3>Step 1</h3>

		<p>Pour the chicken broth into a saucepan with the onion and garlic; bring to a boil and cook at a boil until the liquid reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, return to a boil, and reduce the liquid by half again, about 10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, rosemary, and sage; simmer until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their juice, about 15 more minutes. Stir in cream, butter, lemon, and capers; reduce heat and simmer the sauce until thickened, about 10 minutes (45 minutes in all).</p>

		<h3>Step 2</h3>

		<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

		<h3>Step 3</h3>

		<p>Place the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and press the chicken thighs into the cornstarch on all sides until thoroughly coated. Shake off excess cornstarch. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; pan-fry the chicken thighs until they develop a golden brown crust, about 8 minutes per side. Place the chicken thighs into a 9x9-inch baking dish and pour the sauce over the chicken.</p>

		<h3>Step 4</h3>

		<p>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
