		<h2>Description</h2>

		<p>My husband's grandmother used to make this chowder for him when he was a child. When we got married, she passed the recipe onto me. Enjoy!</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Â½ cup diced bacon</li>
				<br>
			<li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
				<br>
			<li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
				<br>
			<li>2 cups water</li>
				<br>
			<Li>3 cups cream-style corn</Li>
				<br>
			<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
				<br>
			<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
				<br>
			<li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>

		<h3>Step 1</h3>

		<p>Place the bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp. Drain and crumble, reserving about 2 tablespoons drippings in the pot.</p>

		<h3>Step 2</h3>

		<p>Mix potatoes and onion into the pot with the crumbled bacon and reserved drippings. Cook and stir 5 minutes. Pour in the water, and stir in corn. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover pot. Simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until potatoes are tender.</p>

		<h3>Step 3</h3>

		<p>Warm the half-and-half in a small saucepan until it bubbles. Remove from heat before it boils, and mix into the chowder just before serving.</p>
